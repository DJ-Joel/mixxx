/// Two tables, both created on demand with CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS and
/// not part of Mixxx's versioned schema (so official schema updates cannot
/// collide with them, and official Mixxx ignores them):
///  - `autodj_energy`: measured by AnalyzerEnergy, rewritten on re-analysis
///  - `autodj_energy_manual`: the DJ's own 1..10 rating, never overwritten
///    by analysis. A rating always wins over the measured value.
///  - `autodj_auto_markers`: the Intro End / Outro Start positions the
///    analyzer set itself, so it can tell them apart from markers the DJ set
///    or moved (those are never touched).
///  - `autodj_grid_check`: how far the track's beat grid drifts off the
///    music (EnergyCalculator::gridDriftBeats), and which grid was checked,
///    so a grid the DJ changes later is checked again.
